Weekly quiz
===========

It is expected that you will not have time to answer all questions. Try to answer at least one question from each section. (Questions nearer the top of each section are more important to know.)

Ruby basics
-----------

1) Describe the following ruby objects:
for instance [1,2,3] would be "an array containing three elements, the integer 1, the integer 2 and the integer 3"
and "" would be "a blank string"

1a) :crocodile
A symbol

1b) "145.73"
A string

1c) { :coffee => "cafe" }
a Hash

1d) [ :green, :eggs, :ham ]
An Array

1e) ["tea", {"juice" => "orange"}]
An array with a hash in

2) Here is an array:
array = ["Molly", "Greg", "Taz"]
Write a line of ruby that appends the values "Jay" and "Mona" to the array.

array << ["Jay", "Mona"]

3) Here is a hash:
hash = { :cow => "Moo", :sheep => "Baah" }
Write a line of ruby that replaces the value of the key :sheep with "Bleat".

hash[:cow]="Bleat"

4) The file number_converter.rb contains a method called convert_number that doesn't do anything.

Replace the #??? comment inside it so that:
  if the argument passed is greater than 5, it returns 3 times the number,
  and if it is less than or equal to 5 it returns the number minus 3.

5) Write a method that takes one argument (an array full of strings) and `puts` each word separately, but in uppercase.

def method(array)
	$i = 0
	$num = array.length
	$a = 0

while $i < $num  do
   puts array.upcase[$a]
   $a +=1
  end 
end

6) What's the difference between an object and an instance?

you have an instance of an object and manipulate an object with an instance

Testing
-------
7) robot.rb contains a simple class with two methods. robot_spec.rb is the start of a spec file - it runs, but there aren't any tests in it.

a) Write a test that checks greet('Ada') returns the string "HELLO ADA".
b) Write a test that checks calculate(4, 5) returns 9.
c) Write a test that checks calculate(5, 'horse') returns 5.

8) Explain the difference between the rspec methods let and subject.
